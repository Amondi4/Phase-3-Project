    "SyriaTel, a leading telecommunications company, faces a significant challenge in retaining its customer base. Customer churn, or the loss of customers to competitors, can have a substantial impact on the company's revenue and profitability. Acquiring new customers is generally more expensive than retaining existing ones, making customer retention a critical aspect of SyriaTel's business strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the highly competitive telecommunications market, customers have numerous options and can easily switch to other service providers if they are dissatisfied with the quality of service, pricing, or other factors. Identifying customers at risk of churning and taking proactive measures to address their concerns can significantly improve customer loyalty and reduce the potential revenue loss associated with churn."
